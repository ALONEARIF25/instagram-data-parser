## Media Support üì∑üé•üéôÔ∏è

The parser now supports displaying photos, videos, and audio files from your Instagram messages.

### Supported Media Types:

#### Photos

- JSON format: `message.photos[].uri`
- Extracts filename: `photos/541014218_24975885822064344_4254740121701931398_n_24975885818731011.jpg`
- Displays as clickable image previews

#### Videos

- JSON format: `message.videos[].uri`
- Extracts filename: `videos/541995394_24403540885975736_1780615188516915780_n_1299041071913939.mp4`
- Displays with HTML5 video player controls

#### Audio Files

- JSON format: `message.audio_files[].uri`
- Extracts filename: `audio/audioclip17566296770003808_779861381098123.mp4`
- Displays with HTML5 audio player controls

### How to Use Media Features:

1. **Upload JSON Files**: Select your message\_\*.json files as usual
2. **Upload Media Folder**: Click the new "Select Media Folder" button
3. **Select Folder**: Choose the folder containing photos, videos, and audio subdirectories
   - The folder structure should match Instagram's export format
   - Example: `your_instagram_activity/messages/inbox/[chat_name]/`
4. **Process Files**: Click "Process Files" button
5. **View Media**: Media will now appear in:
   - Lowest Activity Day messages
   - Date picker messages
   - Embedded directly in the chat bubbles

### Media Display Features:

- **Photos**: Show as clickable previews, click to open full size in new tab
- **Videos**: Embedded video player with controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
- **Audio**: Embedded audio player with controls and waveform
- **Fallback**: If media file not found, shows media indicator with filename
- **Responsive**: Media scales appropriately on mobile devices

### File Parsing:

The parser extracts only the filename from the URI path:

```
From: "your_instagram_activity/messages/inbox/user_123/photos/photo.jpg"
To: "photo.jpg"
```

This allows the parser to match files regardless of the folder structure you upload.

## Usage Tips

1. **Large Media Folders**: Be patient when uploading large folders with many media files
2. **File Matching**: Ensure filenames in JSON match the actual file names in your upload
3. **Missing Media**: If media doesn't load, check browser console for errors
4. **Date Format**: Dates use GMT+6 timezone as configured in your parser
